# Foxx Sessions Example App

This is the official example app for the Foxx `activateSessions` feature ArangoDB 2.3.

See the source of `index.js` for more details. The `activateSessions` feature is documented in the Sessions section of the Foxx chapter of the ArangoDB 2.3 documentation. The built-in users, sessions and simple-auth apps are documented in the chapter on Foxx Bundled Apps.

If you want to mount this app and use the OAuth2 examples, make sure to mount the [official OAuth2 app](https://github.com/arangodb/foxx-oauth2) at `/oauth2`.
